look over there at the tree ; it is pink I had no idea such things
exist ; if you try to envision one you'll fail because there isn't
anything quite like such a tree ; it is small because only small
plants avoid being cut down ; you do not have to take my word for this
since believe it or not we live near one ; at least you do , maybe I
do not ; who knows .
